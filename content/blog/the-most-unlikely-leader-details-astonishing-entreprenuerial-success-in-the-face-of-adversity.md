Former President and CEO of American Income Life Insurance and Liberty National [Roger Smith](https://rogersmith.me/) recounts his remarkable rise to entrepreneurial success after navigating insurmountable obstacles in his newly released memoir, [The Most Unlikely Leader: An Unbelievable Journey](https://www.amazon.com/Most-Unlikely-Leader-Unbelievable-Journey/dp/1955026130) From GED To CEO (Ballast Books). 
 
Available now, this business and leadership memoir takes readers on an unflinching journey through Smith’s lowest moments as he struggles with homelessness, battles addiction and depression, and drops out of high school. Smith describes how, against all odds, he turned his life around and was put in charge of one of the largest life insurance companies in the world. As CEO, he helped transform the way life insurance industries operate and do business. 
 
From Smith’s first foray into entrepreneurship as a young boy selling comic books on the streets of New York City, to his first sales job in Compton, California, to his taking over American Income Life, his astounding story reveals that with grit and relentlessness, you can become anything you set your mind to. Smith rose through the ranks of American Income relying on nothing but his wit, work ethic and his evolving understanding of what it takes to build teams and lead national organizations. 
 
Praised by Kirkus Reviews for its fast-paced, no-holds-barred storytelling style, The Most Unlikely Leader truly embodies the fact that no matter how low you are in life, you can rise above the challenges you face: “The arc of Smith’s life is extraordinary—he managed to become an accomplished businessperson and family man after years of drug-addled purposelessness. His candor is also remarkable—he spares no punches when it comes to self-judgment and chronicles his foibles in granular detail.”
