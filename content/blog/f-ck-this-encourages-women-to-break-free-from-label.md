Justine Evirs, business consultant, entrepreneur, and Navy Veteran, has been labeled all her life. In her forthcoming debut memoir, *Fuck This: Permission Granted to Own Your Story* (May ‘22/Ballast Books), Evirs declares: No longer. 

Biracial. Bisexual. Rape survivor. Recovering binge-eater and alcoholic. Mother. Wife. Military veteran. These are the labels Evirs refuses to let define her. Throughout each searingly honest chapter, readers follow along as she triumphs over the invisible shackles and generational trauma that once held her down.  

As Evirs reveals the darkest moments of her past, she aims to serve as an ally and friend to her readers while providing a safe space for them to feel empowered to ask for help sooner than they otherwise would have. Beautiful, unique artwork is found in each section of this powerful guide for traumatized women everywhere. 

Praised for its unapologetic authenticity and vulnerability, F*ck This is sure to resonate with modern women who are struggling to define who they are and who they aspire to be. Evirs invites her readers to cut through the shame in their lives as she opens up about her experiences with a rawness few writers can match. 

Wanona Satcher, CEO & Founder of Mākhers Studio, describes F*ck This as "an authentic, relatable, and approachable story that helps the reader come to terms with their own addictions in a way that's thoughtful, safe, and free. It's a lesson that letting go is hell — but necessary."
