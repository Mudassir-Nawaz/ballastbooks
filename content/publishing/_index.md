First, our editors will do a full deep dive and analysis on your manuscript or book idea—for free. Haven’t started writing yet? Our publishing experts will review your book idea and give you an honest assessment and advice. Need a book doctor? Editor? Ghostwriter? Not sure? We’ll show you your options.

Once an author signs with Ballast Books, we work hand in hand with them on each aspect of book production, no matter where they are in the process. We also handle cover and jacket design, interior layout, e-book formatting, audiobook production, printing in hardcover and paperback, widespread North American distribution, and end-to-end marketing/PR strategies. Not all authors require our complete suite of services, but there is real value in having consistency across your production team for whichever services you do require. We’ll customize our recommendation and proposal for your needs.

- **Quick time to market:** Don’t wait years to release your title. No matter where you are in the writing process, we can get your book published and distributed quickly (though we’ll never rush to failure).

- **Quality:** Whatever format(s) you decide to publish in—hardcover, paperback, Print on Demand, e-book, and/or audiobook—the end result will be of the highest quality.

- **Rights & Control:** You maintain all rights to your work, including editorial and design control.

- **Royalties:** Keep the bulk of revenues and get monthly sales, inventory, and royalty reports.

- **Distribution:** Not only do we distribute and fulfill all orders for you, but our sales team will also actively pitch your book to bookstores and retailers throughout North America.
