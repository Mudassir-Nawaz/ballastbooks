**Would it be crazy to think you could do the same amount of business in less than half the time with zero stress?**

It doesn’t take any fancy new ideas or secret strategies. In fact, looking for those things is precisely what keeps most real estate agents stuck. They lose sight of the essentials, overcomplicate things, and end up working much harder than necessary. 

Real estate is actually a very simple business in which success comes down to one thing: consistent execution of the fundamentals.

With over thirty years of experience coaching real estate agents under his belt, Steve Shull has distilled these fundamentals down to six simple building blocks. They’re all you need to transform your work from an exhausting, never-ending chase into a scalable, stress-free business. In this step-by-step playbook, you’ll discover these building blocks and—most importantly—develop the mindset to execute them relentlessly.

 
### About the Author: 
**Steve Shull** is a former linebacker for the Miami Dolphins. When an injury forced him to change his game—literally—he pivoted into finance, then real estate, and found his calling when he started coaching other real estate agents. After three decades and over 60,000 hours of one-on-one coaching, he knows more about real estate agents than anybody in the business. That insight has led to a unique approach that takes the fear and the fight out of real estate, allowing agents to build stronger businesses while actually enjoying their lives.
