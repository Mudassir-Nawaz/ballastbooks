**Most c-suite executives do not trade the corner office for a room at the psych ward.**

This was the path that Michael Stutts chose. A partner at a prestigious management consultancy, senior executive at a multi-billion-dollar corporation, and lifelong over achiever, Michae l was burned out and broken down when he made a life-changing decision: he checked in to a psychiatric hospital and prioritized mental health over personal achievement. 

In *There’s No Room Service at the Psych Ward*, Michael shares his story and reveals the value of calling the game and starting fresh. You’ll learn practical in sight for navigating the challenges high achievers face and why looking with in and reaching out is vital for success and survival. With levity, vulnerability, and refreshing candor, Michael brings awareness to the mental health crisis and proves that no matter how much you’ve achieved, the best is yet to come.
