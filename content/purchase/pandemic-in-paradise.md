**In late 2019, the world was rocked by the emergence of a “novel” coronavirus. Within months, this deadly virus had spread across the globe, quickly gaining pandemic status.**

But when COVID-19 began ravaging Hawai’i, the state failed to respond effectively to protect its residents. As the number of cases began to skyrocket, the few epidemiological specialists tasked with investigation and contact tracing quickly became overwhelmed. Meanwhile, leadership at the Hawai’i Department of Health (HDOH) falsely reported to the media and general public that staffing was adequate.

Pandemic in Paradise is the historic account of the COVID-19 response in Hawai’i—a response that will go down alongside the burning of Chinatown in 1900 as one of the worst civic disasters in state history. In its pages, Dr. Jennifer Smith, trained virologist and former epidemiological specialist at the HDOH, recounts the failed response efforts and corruption of state leadership she witnessed as a frontline worker during the pandemic. With unflinching honesty, Jennifer reveals how her determination to blow the whistle on that failure and corruption led to her dismissal without cause.

**Science. Politics. Lies. And one shining light of truth. This story has it all—and you won’t be able to put it down.**
