**Climb in the cockpit and join a Marine attack helicopter pilot in this authentic and compelling firsthand account of the opening days and nights of the Iraq War.**<br>
<br>
Experience the sights, smells, and sounds of the Cobra, hanging on tight as you’re hurled into the chaos of night combat operations. Step through an otherwise closed door and explore the emotions, physical danger, and successes that would shape a generation of aviators. <br>
<br>
Author Eric Buer lived to fly the Cobra, delivering incredible firepower and devastating America’s enemies in the aircraft that would become both his home and office. Wherever Marines fought and whenever their commanders needed support, he and his fellow Cobra aircrew were there. In Ghosts of Baghdad, you can be there too. Feel these pilots’ frustrations, experience their exhaustion, and lament alongside them in the face of tragedy. Ultimately, you will come to understand how a sense of duty, service, and shared sacrifice develops into an unbreakable trust and bond.<br>
<br>
Strap in—this true story will take you inside the Cobra for a heart-pounding, fist-pumping, adrenaline-rush-filled thrill ride!<br>
