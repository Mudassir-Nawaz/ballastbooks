<em>Undaunted</em> gives the reader unreserved insight into one man’s rise to glory, his felonious fall from grace, and his self-willed, seven-year battle to forge himself anew. 

Backed by a never-say-die attitude, he wins back his life and is further able to regain the good graces of his community. 

A warrior never leaves anyone behind on the battlefield, including himself.
