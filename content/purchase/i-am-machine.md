## *I Am Machine* is an intriguing exploration of what it means to be human—and whether we truly have free will. 

This thought-provoking narrative will ignite your imagination while causing you to question what drives your own actions and decisions. Whether you’re interested in philosophy and science fiction or simply curious about the human experience, *I Am Machine* will engage your brain in a way unlike any other book in your personal library.

Written from the perspective of an alien visitor to Earth named Ramona Black Hole, *I Am Machine* rationalizes human existence in the context of a universe filled with life. Throughout the book, Ramona, leader of the globular cluster Messier 13 galactic exploration team, describes life on Earth in the context of her prior planetary experiences, including those with other extraterrestrials she’s encountered.

Although Ramona isn’t human, she has a lot of the same questions about life that humans have grappled with since their evolution on Earth. What does it mean to be alive? How much control do we truly have over our lives? What else is out there? Are there parallel universes and alternative realities that we aren’t aware of? Just what is possible in infinite space? Ramona has traveled broadly in our galaxy, the Milky Way, and shares her hypotheses about life and free will, but it’s up to you to decide what you think the universe holds.
