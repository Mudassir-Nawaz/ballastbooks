**What would you be willing to risk to simply do the right thing?**

In his debut book, Adam DeMarco chronicles his journey from his early childhood days to his call to arms after 9/11, from the deployments to southwest Asia to the highs and lows of the political campaign trail, and from picking up the pieces of failure after failure to finding his renewed sense of purpose.

He also gives a no-holds-barred firsthand account of three of the most significant events to occur in recent American history: the protests at Lafayette Square, the Capitol insurrection, and the fight to save Americans and allies in Afghanistan.

With his characteristic flair and love of history, Adam provides a detailed account of his journey of discovering his true inner self through his military and public service, all the while openly battling invisible wounds.
