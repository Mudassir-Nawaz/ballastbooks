   On September 11, 2018, Navy SEAL Chief Edward Gallagher—a highly-decorated combat veteran with nine deployments to war zones in Africa, Afghanistan, and Iraq—was arrested for war crimes at the TBI medical clinic where he was receiving treatment. 
review: "This is a book that sadly will polarize. It shouldn’t be that way, but regrettably that’s where we are as a country. If readers could take the time to consider Gallagher’s almost 20 year of service, his drive to become a SEAL, (spoken about in the book), and then really considered the travesty of injustice foisted upon him and his family, this story becomes HUMAN interest, not a political parse."

**On September 11, 2018, Navy SEAL Chief Edward Gallagher—a highly-decorated combat veteran with nine deployments to war zones in Africa, Afghanistan, and Iraq—was arrested for war crimes at the TBI medical clinic where he was receiving treatment.**

His incarceration was the culmination of a year-long whisper campaign started by a group of disgruntled members of his SEAL platoon after a successful deployment fighting ISIS in Mosul, Iraq. At the end of that deployment, Chief Gallagher was named the #1 chief at SEAL Team 7, put in for a Silver Star for valor on the battlefield, and listed for promotion to Senior Chief. The junior members whom Chief Gallagher had called out for cowardice and ineptitude in combat decided they couldn't let any of those things stand, and escalated minor complaints into false accusations of stabbing a captured ISIS fighter and shooting noncombatants that gained international attention. 

Despite a corrupt investigation and a deceitful prosecutor who would be removed from the case for spying on defense attorneys, Chief Gallagher was found innocent on all major charges, and freed from prison. But only after his family was put through hell, and President Trump intervened to allow Chief Gallagher a fair trial in a military justice system designed to break and persecute our country's warfighters. 

While heavily covered in the media, the full story of how a war hero was railroaded and nearly sent to prison for life for crimes he didn't commit has never been told. Chief Gallagher did not testify at his trial, and has spoken in little detail about how this travesty came about. Until now. A shocking, raw, tell-all expose that pulls no punches, and identifies each and every bad actor in this surreal story. 

Book includes QR codes that link to videos of the accusers’ NCIS interviews, trial audio, and text message threads highlighting the plot to take Chief Gallagher down.

*"People always tell me, if our life was a movie, no one would believe it."*
