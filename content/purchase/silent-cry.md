**Red roses: a symbol of love and devotion or a sinister sign of blood soon to be spilled?**

At first glance, Seneca Rocks seems to be a typical small town where everyone knows everyone, and nothing stays a secret for long. However, the bucolic charm of this quaint community is abruptly shattered when one of the town’s golden girls is found murdered in the woods. Wearing a crimson nightie and surrounded by red rose petals, Kate Williams, as beautiful as ever even in death, jolts awake this sleepy town, alerting it to the evil lurking just out of sight. 

Detective Raelynn Bailey has never faced such a horrific crime before, but now, she’s suddenly responsible for identifying a cold-blooded killer living among them. As she delves into Kate’s past, discovering alarming secrets that had been deliberately hidden from the rest of the community, Raelynn can’t help but wonder whether the murderer is even closer to her than she could have ever imagined. While battling her own personal demons and perhaps finding a love interest along the way, she ruthlessly investigates the worst crime Seneca Rocks has ever seen while tirelessly advocating for the town’s fallen angel.

When another woman—this time, a newcomer to the town—is brutally killed, there’s no doubt: Seneca Rocks has its very own serial killer. Will Raelynn capture the perpetrator and protect the place she’s always called home? Or will the killer strike again—possibly taking down Raelynn herself—before she can get to the bottom of the mystery? A riveting crime thriller with a twisting and twisted narrative, *Silent Cry* will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first page to the last.
