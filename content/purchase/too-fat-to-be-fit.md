**Believe in yourself—even when no one else does.**<br>
<br>
It’s hard. We are told so many things throughout our lives. People form opinions that make us think we are a certain way, and when we are told these things over and over, we start to believe them. But we need to remember that when we hear that voice, it isn’t our own. It is the voice of others projecting their impressions—accurate or not—upon us. It does not define who we are.<br>
<br>
We define who we are, and we can be so many things: silly, smart, kind, and so much more. <br>
<br>
*Too Fat to Be Fit* shares my journey of overcoming the onslaught of negative opinions that chased me from childhood to adulthood and from my family life to my fitness career. This book explores my struggles, my feelings, my acknowledgment, and my breakthrough—and it wasn’t a straight line to get there. Like everyone else, my path has had many twists and turns, but I have discovered my true value along the way. Join me on my journey to recognize your own self-worth and potential for success!<br>
