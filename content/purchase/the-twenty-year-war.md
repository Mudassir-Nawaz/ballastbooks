review: "After receiving my own copy of The Twenty Year War I was blown away by how beautiful this book is! But as beautiful as the book is, the accounts of these veterans telling their own stories will give you a new appreciation for these brave men and women and what they went through while in the military to preserve our freedom. The book is well-written and the photography is top-notch with each picture capturing the essence of each one of these people. I highly recommend this book!"

**Breathtaking. Personal. Raw. The Twenty-Year War photo book is an eye-opening insight into the lives of 71 incredible veterans of the Global War on Terror.**

Diving into the experience of American service members fighting in a conflict that has spanned two decades, The Twenty-Year War explores the challenge veterans face reintegrating into a society where less than 1 percent of the American populace has served in the conflict.

The Twenty-Year War is an unflinching look at what it means to serve both in uniform and out. The portraits are explosive, telling, and gritty looks at the authentic life of an American service member. 

The veterans featured in The Twenty-Year War open up about their call to service, the sobering reality of combat, their transition post-military, and what it’s like to find their mission again — in life.

This book shares stories not often told, including stories of fathers and sons, sisters, brothers, and husbands and wives who served together. The Twenty-Year War is a triumph of the American veteran’s spirit and determination.
