## Few people manage to make a true impact on others the way Mike Adams did during his life. 

As a professor, columnist, and friend, he left an indelible mark on nearly everyone he met, moving them to become the best versions of themselves through his witty yet thought-provoking remarks. Although Mike passed away in 2020, his legacy lives on through the insights he shared in his writing—the greatest examples of which have been carefully compiled by his surviving brother, David. These narratives serve to map out the major events of Mike’s life while shining a light on the positive influence he had on those he encountered along the way.

A touching testament to someone who was loved by many, *Life and How to Live It* tells the story of a life well lived by a man transformed—from a D student to an A student, from an atheist to a Christian, and from a liberal to a conservative. It honors a beloved leader who devoted himself to educating and inspiring others in life and who continues to do so now that he’s gone. With Mike’s trademark humor and wisdom leaping from every page and David’s commentary providing meaningful context, this book is sure to ignite a desire in every reader to examine their beliefs and consider how to make a lasting difference in the world.


## Author Bios:

<b>Mike S. Adams</b> graduated from Mississippi State University in 1993 with a PhD in criminology and became a professor at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington (UNCW). He also wrote columns for Townhall and The Daily Wire and spoke frequently on first amendment and pro-life issues. Although Mike twice won the Faculty Member of the Year Award, in 2006, he was denied a promotion to full professor and filed suit in federal court, alleging that UNCW had retaliated against him. The lawsuit set up a legal challenge concerning whether Garcetti v. Ceballos (2006) applied to college professors. In 2014, Mike finally won before a jury in federal court in North Carolina. He passed away in 2020.

<b>David Adams</b>, Mike's only sibling, is a retired computer programmer. He enjoys photography and traveling with his wife and is dedicated to keeping Mike's legacy alive. Mike and David were born in Columbus, Mississippi, and grew up in Houston near NASA, where their parents worked.
