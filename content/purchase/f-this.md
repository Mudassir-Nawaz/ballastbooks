**F*ck This: Permission Granted to Own Your Story is about everything women once had to endure in silence. In this shocking and honest memoir, Justine Evirs declares: No longer.**

Justine Evirs has been labeled all her life: Biracial. Bisexual. Rape survivor. Recovering binge-eater and alcoholic. Mother. Wife. Military veteran. But she refused to let any of them define her.

With a rawness that few writers can match, Evirs narrates her tumultuous life while also providing a safe space and encouragement for readers to acknowledge and overcome their own obstacles.

With each chapter, readers will observe Evirs destroy the invisible shackles and generational trauma that held her down. They will also gain an ally and a friend, for the author shares the darkest sides of herself in the hope that readers will feel empowered to ask for help sooner than they otherwise would have.

As Nikki James Zellner, author of Capture Your Story: A Driven Woman's Guide to Creating Content That Matters, said: “F*ck This … should be required reading for anyone struggling to define who they were and who they can be."

> *“Justine is a courageous and engaging writer. She shares her story in a way that leaves the reader feeling inspired to embrace truth in their own lives. Her story is so compelling, you will want to read it in one sitting.”*
