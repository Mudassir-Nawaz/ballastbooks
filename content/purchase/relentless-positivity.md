**Author Kyle Cozad — retired US Navy Rear Admiral and current President and CEO of the Naval Aviation Museum Foundation tells his own personal story following a service-related spinal cord injury while he was on active duty.**

Insightful, honest, and frank, his account describes how he bounced back from a debilitating spinal cord injury with one overarching motivation: to “give back” and make a positive difference for others.  His leadership as a senior Navy two-star admiral serving on active duty, and his current role as President and CEO of the Naval Aviation Museum Foundation exemplify his grit and resilience and a commitment as a societal change agent.   

*Relentless Positivity* is a must-read for anyone facing personal adversity in their lives. It is an inspirational personal story of toughness and resilience from which Wounded Warriors, their families, and anyone who has faced major trauma in their lives will be encouraged in overcoming incredible odds.
