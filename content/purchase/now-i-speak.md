On November 4th, 2011, in Port Townsend, Washington, Anna Nasset was creating a window display after hours at the art gallery she proudly called her own. When a man appeared before her with a painting under his arm, Anna experienced the briefest moment of hesitation before opening her door—and her world—to a man who would stop at nothing in his attempts to tear her life apart from that moment forward. That is, until Anna decided to stand up and fight back.<br>
<br>
Now a fierce public advocate for creating awareness around the discreet crime that controlled her every move for the better part of a decade, Anna shares her experience as a survivor of stalking in a ruthless fight for justice in *Now I Speak.*<br>
<br>
Told through a series of flashbacks, first-person narration, and evidence from the landmark case that saw her stalker receive one of the longest sentences for the crime in U.S. history, *Now I Speak* delves even deeper into Anna’s personal past to uncover a history of abuse and vulnerability, each experience adding fuel to the fire of Anna’s determination.<br>
<br>
Coming this summer, Anna’s debut memoir provides a clear call to action: It’s time to stand up to stalking.<br>

<br>

**Anna Nasset**, a victim/survivor of stalking for the last decade, has firsthand experience with how to identify and respond to stalking, which has led her to become an international speaker on the subject. She has trained thousands of professionals, students, and military members on the importance of recognizing stalking, getting help, and advocating for oneself and others. Anna is one of very few people who can speak openly about her experience after the man who stalked her received the maximum sentence for aggravated felony stalking—ten years in prison—in 2019. This is one of the longest known sentences for this crime in U.S. history.

<br>
As an activist and the owner of Stand Up Resources, Anna works with law enforcement, victim service agencies, universities, and other organizations to be part of the solution. As an authority on stalking, sexual assault, suicide prevention, and navigating the criminal justice system, she works to educate people on victim-centered and trauma-informed practices.

Anna is the recipient of the 2023 NCVRW Survivor Empowerment Award for embodying the theme “Survivor Voices: Elevate. Engage. Effect Change.” In addition, she is a board member with End Violence Against Women International (EVAWI) and the Mad River Valley Chamber of Commerce. She also hosts a podcast, *The Mend* (sponsored by the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services), which focuses on topics and services to support crime victims. She resides in the Green Mountains of Vermont with her three-legged chihuahua, Dolly Parton, and is excited about her first book, *Now I Speak*, coming out later this year.
