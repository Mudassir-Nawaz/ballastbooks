**What you're made to believe is wrong about you is what’s strong about you.**

We spend over 90,000 hours of our lives in the workplace, suppressing parts of ourselves to fit into the “culture.” What we don’t realize is that it’s stifling our creativity—and even killing us. With that in mind, what advice would you give your younger self about embracing who you are in the workplace?

In Unmask Your Brilliance, global executive advisor and prominent business technology voice Michelle Mehrnoosh Bazargan unveils an "insider's" perspective on workplace pressures for conformity and false narratives, all while providing practical tools to overcome them.

Bazargan highlights the unconscious traumas that drive us into survival mode, causing us to mask and silence our voices. Drawing on extensive research and her own personal experiences, she guides readers away from normalized toxic corporate mentalities and toward personal growth to become better individuals.
