**What happened to our nation? The United States of America that the founding fathers created was driven by much different values than those that permeate the government and much of society today.**

John Mogen, a conservative retiree and true patriot in every sense of the word, can no longer sit back and watch his beloved country slide further and further away from what it was intended to be. Determined to make a positive change, he decides to write a fictional book about restoring the Constitution. However, when he shares his idea with his brother-in-law, Carl, he sets into motion a much larger chain of events than he ever could have imagined.

With the help of his loving wife, Jaylynn, and the Arlington Colonels' Club, consisting of four former military leaders, including brother-in-law Carl, John embarks on a quest to form a new republic of red and religious states called the Western Southern Alliance (WSA). Hundreds of allies from coast to coast secretly work together to support John, who has agreed to be the face of the restoration-the civilian militia commander leading the effort.

John and Jaylynn know that this endeavor has only three possible outcomes: death, prison, or success. What will come of this bold and audacious plan? Will these patriots achieve their goal-or die trying? Read *A Patriot's Dream* to learn their fate-and the fate of this great nation called the United States of America!


### About the Author:
**Kent Thompson** grew up in Newcastle, Wyoming. When he was a junior in high school, his family moved to California, where he attended Atascadero High School before completing two years of college at Cuesta Junior College in San Luis Obispo. Most importantly, during this time, he met and married his high school sweetheart, Susan. Together, they moved back to Wyoming so Kent could finish college at the University of Wyoming, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in history. What started as a summer job at an oil refinery to replenish funds so he could continue his education turned into a career in the oil industry. The original goal was to teach history and coach football and basketball, but God had other plans. During the last eight years of Kent's career, he supervised three offshore platforms off Long Beach, California. He worked with Navy SEAL TRADET to plan SEAL training on those platforms for the last five years of his career. He is a lifelong student of the U.S. Constitution and the Federalist Papers. Kent and Susan live in the small mountain town of Pine, Arizona. They will never actually "retire." They have three grown children and two grandsons.
