**Adventure and growth.**

That’s what has defined the life of Ashton Pienaar, star of *Below Deck*. From quitting his steady corporate job without a backup plan to moving to France to kickstart a yachting career to becoming a fan favorite, then villain, on Bravo’s hit reality show, Ashton has approached each new phase of life with his mantra: “Find security in the unknown.” While this has presented some challenges, it has also helped him become a happier, more confident person—someone who thrives in uncertainty and makes the best of every situation.

Now, Ashton has captured his bold and passionate pursuit of purpose in his gripping memoir, *Knots, Lines, and Life*. This tale of self-discovery and self-improvement offers a no-holds-barred reflection on Ashton’s experiences, good and bad, in his own words. With unflinching candor and raw intensity, he invites the reader into his experiences with substance use and alcoholism—then takes them on a journey of healing and transformation as he shares his road to sobriety and his ongoing success as an entrepreneur and business owner.

Most memoirs are inspiring, but this is a story that goes a step further. *Knots, Lines, and Life* will incite positive action in readers, prompting them to forgive themselves and others for their mistakes, embrace every opportunity to learn and grow, and, of course, find security in the unknown.
