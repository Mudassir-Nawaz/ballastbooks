**If you’re a real estate agent, you know that teams are the future of the business. Soon, you’ll either be leading a team, working on a team, or competing against a team. This is inescapable.**

The old model of lone agents is going by the wayside for a simple reason: one person can’t get it all done anymore. In the modern real estate industry, selling a home takes more work than anyone can handle by themselves. A single agent simply can’t compete against a high-functioning team.

Unfortunately, most teams are teams in name only. Instead of building a high-functioning team, most team leaders end up working harder, making less, and experiencing more stress. This is what happens when you don't understand the fundamental principles of team dynamics. Constructing and operating a cohesive and successful real estate team is a very different challenge than being a "rainmaker agent" who lists and sells property in high volume.

This book is your step-by-step guide to doing real estate teams right. Whether you’re a team leader, a team member, or just thinking of starting or joining a team, The Real Estate Team Playbook will show you how to band together and succeed in real estate through synergistic collaboration.

### About the Authors: 

Introducing **Steve Shull…**

Over the past thirty years, Steve Shull has been a guiding force in the realm of real estate coaching. He has devoted more than 60,000 hours to nurturing the growth of real estate professionals with one singular mission: to strategically position his clients for unparalleled success. The core of his coaching philosophy can be found in his bestselling real estate book, The Full Fee Agent (co-authored with Chris Voss).

Steve grew up outside Philadelphia and studied at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he played football and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree. His dream of playing in the NFL came true when he earned the rare opportunity to join the Miami Dolphins as a free agent. He played for four impactful years under legendary coach Don Shula, resulting in his designation as one of the tri-captains during the 1982 Super Bowl. When a knee injury ended his football career, Steve embarked on a new chapter, pursuing an MBA at the University of Miami. His subsequent tenure as an institutional fixed-income salesperson on Wall Street proved his adaptability and acumen. However, it was his migration to real estate that truly marked his destiny.

Steve's journey in this industry has encompassed an array of roles, from selling homes to co-founding a pioneering real estate enterprise. His counsel has been sought by major real estate brands, and his voice has resonated at prominent industry conferences, complementing his established coaching practice. Steve's unique perspective is the culmination of a multi-faceted immersion in nearly every aspect of the real estate realm.

In his upcoming book, *Real Estate Is Not Rocket Science*, Steve continues to distill his wealth of knowledge, offering invaluable insights to empower real estate professionals in their pursuit of excellence. Stay tuned as he once again reshapes the landscape of success in the ever-evolving world of real estate.
