Both timely and timeless, this book leaves young readers moved to face hardship with the courage and creativity of Marisol.

### About the Author:
“Let’s get our hands dirty and make stuff.”

That’s the family motto of impressionist artist Emily “EMYO” Ozier. A Tennessee girl with Cuban roots, EMYO has lived a life full of art. From paper dolls wearing napkin dresses to a 3D house for a family of painted bumblebees, EMYO spent her childhood creating.

Today, EMYO lives and creates art alongside her husband and six children on a grassy piece of land in Tennessee. Her art is featured in galleries across the country, all the way from Palm Beach to Portland, Maine, and is collected far and wide. Her paintings are layered with inspiration. From her Cuban heritage and her impressionist training to the love, laughter, and gratitude that fills her home.​
