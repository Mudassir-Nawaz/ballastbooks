**Most feel blessed to grow up Amish-but not Rosa.**

Although she appreciates many aspects of the culture she was raised in, the abuse she suffered at the hands of her own brother and the lack of support she received from the rest of her family ultimately led her down a different path-one that would be characterized by light instead of the darkness that had shrouded her all her life.

*My Path to Light: How I Escaped the Darkness of an Abusive Amish Childhood* paints a comprehensive picture of what it means to be Amish and how her experience was unique-but not for the better. With gut-wrenching honesty and earnest introspection, Rosa Miller opens up about the highs and lows of her upbringing, her internal struggle over conflicting beliefs, and how she drew the courage to leave her family behind in pursuit of a brighter future.

Set off on the path to spiritual and emotional liberation with Rosa as she vividly describes various facets of Amish lifestyle. Hold her heart in your hands as she bravely discusses the molestation she endured and how she stood up against it to protect her younger female family members. And walk alongside Rosa as she steadfastly commits to following Jesus and using Him as a guide for her life journey. With My Path to Light, you will be inspired to march out of the darkness and into the light, just as Rosa did.
