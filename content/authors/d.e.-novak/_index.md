D.E. Novak lives blissfully in Eugene, Oregon, with her beloved cats and betta fishes. She is a graduate of West Virginia University as well as the school of life. An avid figure skater, she also skis, hikes, and loves to garden. You are going to want her on your team in trivia games, especially when the categories are music or movies. And she’s been known to rock the karaoke mic with gusto! Lastly, if you ask her nicely, she’ll even read your tarot cards.
