Ashton Pienaar is perhaps best known for his role on Bravo’s hit reality TV show *Below Deck*. He
appeared on season six as a deckhand and was so popular that he was invited back as a bosun on
season seven. One of his most notable experiences on the show was when he nearly lost his life
after being dragged into the water from his foot being caught in a line. Fortunately, he was saved by
a quick-thinking cameraman.

As is the case with all reality TV stars, Ashton was both loved and hated by viewers of *Below Deck*.
This motivated him to wholeheartedly focus on his mindset and personal development after the
show. Since his time on *Below Deck*, Ashton has inspired countless fans by steadfastly improving
every area of his life, including achieving sobriety. Today, Ashton is three years sober and eager to
help others rise up from rock bottom the way he did.

Although he grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa, Ashton now lives in Raleigh, North Carolina. He
is the founder and CEO of AP-Elite, a fitness and health company dedicated to helping others
achieve optimal health and fulfillment in their own lives through custom nutrition, training, and
mindset coaching.
