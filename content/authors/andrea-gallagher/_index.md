Andrea Gallagher rose to national prominence after her husband, Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, was imprisoned for war crimes he did not commit. She fought tirelessly behind the scenes to have her husband released from pretrial confinement in order to participate in his defense, successfully lobbying President Trump to move him out of the brig. After Chief Gallagher was found not guilty of murder by a jury of his peers, President Trump reinstated his rank and ensured a vindictive navy admiral did not remove his Trident, the insignia identifying him as a Navy SEAL. Today, Andrea is the president of The Pipe Hitter Foundation, a non-profit founded by her and Eddie to provide support for other service members and law enforcement officers stuck in a corrupt legal system.
