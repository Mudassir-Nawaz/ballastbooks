Justine Evirs is a business consultant, Stanford University Graduate School of Business alum, and Navy veteran. She teaches women executives and entrepreneurs how to create consistent revenue models and business plans. Her authentic leadership style — paired with her passion for building psychologically safe, inclusive environments — are the secrets to the energetic and high-powered teams she builds and leads.

As the owner and creator of the signature twelve-week programs Courage to Create and Courage to Lead, she teaches leaders to trust their instincts in creating values-based organizations and solutions to worldwide social problems. As the Founder of The Paradigm Switch, she helped to raise more than $500,000 in donations and led more than forty volunteers.

She also flexed her grassroots community organizing and nonprofit leadership skills during a three-year tenure at Bunker Labs, a nonprofit that helps veterans and military spouses start businesses. She is a frequent speaker and podcast guest, and is the mother of three children. She lives in Burke, VA.
