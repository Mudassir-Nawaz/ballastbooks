Barbara Powers Wyatt was born in Salem, New Jersey, where she attended Salem public schools. In 1953, she graduated from Clarke Conservatory of Music and went on to teach music in her hometown. Two years later, in pursuit of something bigger than small town life, she began a new profession as an airline stewardess with Trans World Airlines (TWA). After just three months, she met her future husband, Captain Frederic Wyatt, USNR, and together they built a family that included three sons. They would also work together in executive search, in politics, and with the military, all while teaching throughout Los Angeles County. In 1980, she served as part of the Reagan Administration for both of his terms. In one of their many endeavors together, she and her husband created and compiled the book We Came Home: POWs of Vietnam. To honor the POWs, she has updated their stories for the 50th anniversary of their homecoming. She currently lives in Las Vegas where she spends time writing and enjoying time with her family.
