Kelly Speck once thought she would spend her life as a working mom and wife, hustling in Corporate America while volunteering for the PTA. Life’s numerous curveballs, however, have prompted an evolution; she now considers herself a recovering type-A planner. 

For more than twenty years now, she has performed accounting in an array of industries while maintaining a strong marriage to her college sweetheart, Travis. Kelly and Travis have three children who have, along with her deep faith, humbled her profoundly. 

When her high school friends voted her "Most Likely to Drive a Minivan," she scoffed and declared that would never happen. Ironically, the Specks currently own not one but two minivans. 

Kelly's favorite of the two has a ramp for her oldest son, Bennett, a quadriplegic, and she considers it the world’s greatest honor to serve as chauffeur for him and his two younger siblings. As she faces work’s daily challenges while remaining a proud wife, mom, and caregiver for Bennett, Kelly's mantra is: life is not always easy, but it is always beautiful.
