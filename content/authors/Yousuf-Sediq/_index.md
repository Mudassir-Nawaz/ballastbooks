Yousuf Sediq is a former Afghan Special Forces operator who waged war for fourteen years against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. He fought in his homeland alongside U.S. Army Rangers, Green Berets, Delta Force, Navy SEALs, MARSOC, British SAS, British SBS, Australian Special Forces, Canadian Special Forces, the DEA, and the FBI. Fluent in Dari, Pashto, Farsi, and English, Yousuf Sediq is an expert on Afghanistan. Having lived through the entire conflict and fought at the tip of the spear in both the light and the shadows, his knowledge of the war is rivaled by few. After the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban in 2021, Yousef and his family were evacuated to the United States, where they live today.
