John Patrick Lyons was born in Houston, Texas. At the age of 15, John went to work at the Port of Houston and later in the oilfields of South Texas. John enlisted in the United States Navy in 1985 to become one of the first Navy Special Operations <em>Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen</em> (Navy SWCC). Chief Lyons would go on to become a Navy and Special Operations accredited weapons, ordnance, LASER, and firing ranges expert and instructor. Retiring from the Navy in 2009, John continued working for Naval Special Warfare Command instructing, training, and qualifying West Coast Navy SEALs, SWCCs and other Special Operations personnel in weapons proficiency and gun and LASER firing range safety.   

In 2014, John would learn that he had been massively poisoned with lead. Fired for whistleblowing, he then went to work to find out why. Suffering from congestive heart failure and other degenerative poisoning symptoms, author John P. Lyons continues his whistleblowing in an effort to help his fellow veterans, their families, and the nation overcome the disdain shown by the Navy, government, and its leadership for those they poison.   

An avid outdoorsman and conservationist, Retired Navy Chief John P. Lyons, his wife of thirty years, autistic son, and loyal dogs, Shelby and Diesel, currently reside in his home state of Texas.
