Daniel Huang is a freelance journalist based in Washington, D.C. A graduate of New York University, he previously worked as a staff reporter for The Wall Street Journal, where he covered finance and veterans issues. Since 2016, Dan has lived and reported from across Asia, the Middle East, and the United States. He has primarily covered international affairs, ranging from the elections in Afghanistan to Chinese history and politics. His writing has been published in Foreign Affairs, Guernica, Pacific Standard, and The New Republic. Wounding Warriors expands upon a series of articles Daniel wrote from 2014 to 2016 on fraud and abuses at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. His coverage culminated in a front-page expos√© detailing how the dramatic rise in disability claims has overwhelmed important assessment and control tools at the V.A. Dan's work on the myriad dysfunctions within the veterans disability systems for both The Wall Street Journal and on this book has incorporated wide-ranging firsthand testimonies and research from 60-plus sources, spanning current and former V.A. staffers, policymakers, academics, and crucially, veterans themselves.
