Dan Blakeley served in 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, deploying six times in support of the Global War on Terror. He graduated from Appalachian State University with his bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees. He started the school’s solar-powered racing team that designed and built two solar-powered race cars, competing in five international races. Dan’s transition from military to civilian was not easy. Over the years he has seen firsthand a trend in the veteran community which paralleled his own experiences. “It’s a lack of understanding the skills veterans bring to the table, our proven leadership, our commitment to teammates, our unwavering desire to increase potential and be our best,” Dan said recently. Dan’s passion for veteran success and telling their stories was the inspiration for his first book, The Twenty-Year War. Dan is the Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of United Valor, a company focused on telling the untold stories of war through all media formats.
