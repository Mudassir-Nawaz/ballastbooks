All authors invest in their books, no matter which publishing route they choose. Yes, you read that correctly. All authors. The key financial difference between hybrid publishing and traditional publishing is WHEN the author invests. The hybrid publishing model allows the author to make their investment up front by directly funding the publishing of their work and then reap the reward of 85 percent to 100 percent of royalties on every book sold for years to come.   

When a traditional publisher makes the initial investment in production and distribution costs, the author pays in the form of giving up the majority of royalties—and the rights to their work—to the publisher for the entirety of the contract. Depending on the success of the book, what the author ends up “paying” the publisher in royalties may likely eclipse the publisher’s initial investment many times over. While the traditional option offers a low upfront risk, many authors are discovering it is simply not worth the potential profits they’re forfeiting in the long run.
