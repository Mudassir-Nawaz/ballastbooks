Savannah Spidalieri is a senior acquisitions editor with Ballast Books and its children’s imprint, Blue Balloon Books. Savannah attended Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington where she studied Creative Writing, Publishing and Printing Arts, and Children’s Literature. With over a decade of experience as an editor of fiction and poetry, Savannah is also passionate about helping authors perfect their non-fiction works. When not writing and editing in a professional capacity, she tries to find time to read for enjoyment as well as care for the forty-some houseplants she somehow collected over the past few years. Savannah currently resides with her family outside of Charlottesville, Virginia where her to-be-read stack is embarrassingly long for someone who reads for a living.
