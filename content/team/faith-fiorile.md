A native of Upstate New York, Faith Fiorile holds a bachelor’s degree in English literature and writing. As a publishing associate at Ballast Books and a former marketing manager for several podcasts featuring authors and thought leaders, she consistently engages her enthusiasm for book promotion and content creation. Drawing inspiration from her book blog, where she publishes reviews of books from major trade publishers, Faith’s passion for the book sector has influenced her decision to attend the Columbia Publishing Course at the University of Oxford. She is eager to bring her skill set to the industry and work toward a more inclusive, equitable, and socially responsible future for publishing.
